SYNOPSIS
            {
                    package Message;
                    use Moose 2;
                    with 'MooseX::RemoteHelper::CompositeSerialization';

                    use MooseX::RemoteHelper;

                    has bool => (
                            remote_name => 'Boolean',
                            isa         => 'Bool',
                            is          => 'ro',
                            serializer => sub {
                                    my ( $attr, $instance ) = @_;
                                    return $attr->get_value( $instance ) ? 'Y' : 'N';
                            },

                    );

                    has foo_bar => (
                            remote_name => 'FooBar',
                            isa         => 'Str',
                            is          => 'ro',
                    );

                    __PACKAGE__->meta->make_immutable;
            }

            my $message = Message->new({ Boolean => 1, foo_bar => 'Baz', });

            $message->bool;      # 1
            $message->serialize; # { Boolean => 'Y', FooBar => 'Baz' }

DESCRIPTION
    Many Remote APIs have key names that don't look good in a perl API, such
    as variants of camel case or even names that you don't want to use
    simply because they are inconsistent with your Perl API. This module
    allows you to provide a remote name on your attribute. We also allow you
    to use the remote name as an "init_arg" so that you can more easily
    construct a response from a remote response.

    How the attributes work is documented in
    MooseX::RemoteHelper::Meta::Trait::Attribute

    for serialize read

    MooseX::RemoteHelper::CompositeSerialization

    This module is well tested, but the method, attribute, and module names
    may be subject to change as I haven't decided that I am in love with all
    of them. Also, suggestions welcome to that end. Version will update
    semantically on API change.
